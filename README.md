### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ronald Visser. I am an researcher and lecturer that loves to combine archaeology, dendrochronology, wood research, and computational methods. I love to learn about new things and I prefer to work in R, but other languages are also great. The important thing is to learn, research, and to have fun with nice people.
