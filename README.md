### About me ðŸ‘‹

I am Ronald Visser. I am an researcher and lecturer that loves to combine archaeology, dendrochronology, wood research, and computational methods. I love teaching these things and to work on interdisciplinary projects. Learning new things makes met happy. Most of my research is done using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), but I have worked with other programming languages. The important thing is to learn, research, and to have fun with nice people.

I work at [Saxion University of Applied Sciences](https://www.saxion.nl/) for the [Archaeology-department](https://www.saxion.nl/opleidingen/voltijd/bachelor/archeologie) and for the research group (lectorate) [Sustainable Areas and Soil Transitions](https://www.saxion.nl/onderzoek/areas-and-living/sustainable-areas-and-soil-transitions)
